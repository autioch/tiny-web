<?php $content['template'] = 'internal'; ?>
<p>In folder <var>application&bsol;library</var> there are scripts responsible for functioning
    of the whole framework.</p>
<p>Those are included in sequence, without creating unnecessary objects or overgrown constructions.
It's a large diffrence to other frameworks (ie. Symfony, Zend). It obviously has good and bad sides.</p>
<p class="warning">Modyfing those files is highly NOT recommended. All changes are made at your own risk.
    If you decide to do any changes, feel free to contact me, I might include them in my version.</p>
