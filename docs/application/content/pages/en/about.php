<p>TinyWeb is a simple PHP framework for creating websites. Its creation is guided by
    <?php echo_link_remote('http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle', 'KISS', 'Keep It Simple, Stupid') ?> rule.
    It's all about simplicity, without creating structures, that might be useful for 
    large websites, but in the case of simple pages are a symptom of style over substance.</p>
<p>Created for own use, improved over time, gains new functionalities when needed, while
    I try to keep it simple. Simplicity is a main goal.</p>
<p>At all times, I try to fix and improve generated HTML, so it meets the latest standards. 
    You can see plans and changes in the <?php echo_link('download', $dict['download']) ?>.</p>
<p>It should be kept in mind, that this framework not only helps me creating websites, but also 
    allows me to test and review all the features of PHP, HMTL, JS and CSS at the core.</p>
<p>A minimal knowledge of PHP and HTML is required to use this framework.</p>
